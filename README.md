A quadcoptor simulation

TODO:
next we need to seperate the controller into two parts:
one that only takes sensor readings as inputs as well as 
body frame linear accelerations as targets and that then outputs motor
commands
And another controller that takes in all minimally necessary data to
calculate body frame linear accelerations as output for some target x y z
position
